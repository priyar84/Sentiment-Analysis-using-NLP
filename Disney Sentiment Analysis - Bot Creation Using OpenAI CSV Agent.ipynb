My intention was to go for 5th birthday when she'll be able to remember more but it turned out to be a perfect age   she really was excited to see the princesses! Other highlights for her (and us):The daily Sylvania parade   watched the afternoon show which was just fine. The evening show was too late for the little ones.Fantasyland   she loved the outside rides mostly   teacup ride, Dumbo, Casey Jr train, and carousel especially.PhotoPass   for $60 you get a CD of unlimited photos taken by photographers stationed at the main landmarks (eg, Cinderella Castle, with various characters).Bug's Land in California Adventures   about the only place for a toddler   only spent 1 hour here but would spend more time next trip if I had known more about it.. Tame but fun and cute rides for young ones, similar to Fantasy LandNegatives:Food is mediocre   ate at French Cafe, and twice at Plaza Inn.Food was so so at the French Cafe. First time we went to Plaza Inn the fried chicken was very good. Second time we went it tasted slightly strange   like some chemical in the oil that shouldn't be there. The dinner buffet at Storyteller Cafe was decent but also not worth a special trip if you are staying off park.Ariel's Grotto Princess Breakfast   table visits by the princesses were very brief (maybe 1 2 minutes each); Arielle and Belle were very nice but the people playing Snow White and Cinderella were superficially friendly only   not as nice as the ones at the Princess Faire. Food was bad too. My advice   save your money and wait in line to meet them for free at the Princess Faire.Mixed Opinions:Staying off resort   we stayed at the Marriott Suites Garden Grove, a very nice place and much less expensive than the resort hotels. However we had to rely on the ART shuttle which was often very crowded especially in the evening. It was quite miserable luuging a stroller, while standing with a crying infant shoulder to shoulder after a long day at the park in this bus. I definitely recommend staying walking distance away at one of the hotels on Harbor Blvd or stay at a hotel with its own private shuttle.Disneyland Express   pick up at the airport was flawless however we scheduled a pick up back to the airport but it did not come   we waited for over 1 2 hour and ended up hiring a limo to bring us to John Wayne airport for $45. Ended up losing our pre paid fare which was non refundable. If traveling with at least 4 adults, I would definitely hire a minivan taxi next time   fare is cheaper anyways and they don't require infant or toddler seats, which I did not realize.Hope this helps!\"\n",
      " \"Disney Land is the perfect home away from home. The moment you walk in, it's a blast in the past and your inner child takes over. While walking around, you know all the characters, all the venues, you simply feel like this is the perfect imaginary hideout that has come to life. One word of advice, always buy the priority passes, although a little more expensive, but will save you hours of waiting in line to get on rides. Oh, and keep a lookout for the end of day show. That is an experience of a lifetime full of cartoons projected by lasers on water fountains and an exceptional display of fireworks!Have fun kids!\"\n",
      " \"The most amazing place to take young children. What stood out so much for me was the incredibly happy staff!! Always so friendly, happy, and accommodating. Clean and tidy second to nothing I've ever seen. Not a piece of litter anywhere. Well placed restrooms and eating areas. So well structured and organized. Brilliantly run. A fun filled day for the whole family. \"\n",
      " ...\n",
      " \"I will agree that Disneyworld is the happiest place on earth. Disneyland is definately the unhappiest place on earth after fighting crowds for only a few hours. Disneyland is in dire need of customer service and reconstruction to accomodate the crowds. Each theme park in Disneyworld seems to cater to specific age groups. My son being three years old doesn't need rides that rip his teeth out of his mouth. The MGM Theme Park in Disneyworld catered to smaller rides, puppet shows and low key entertainment. The park has much more room to walk around and lots of stands to buy small items like hot dogs, pretzels, popcorn, ect. Disneyland you will find only snacks that do not contain any other item but sugar...candybars, ice cream bars, soda pop, slushes, etc. If you want real food in Disneyland expect to stand in line at the only 1 or 2 walk up grills, and expect it to be spendy for a sandwich and soda. Oh, there are other restaurants that you can sit down and enjoy a lunch, but for a family of four it will really get spendy. The nice people at Disneyworld never hassle you about your backpacks with one or two bottles of water and a few snacks for your toddler. At Disneyland it is worse that going through airport security. They will confiscate anything edible they can dig out of your bags. My advise....save up the money for flight tickets and spend your money at Disneyworld. It is worth it to visit Mickey and Friends in Florida. You will have a really good time and be treated like royalty.\"\n",
      " \"I just visited Disneyland and was quite disappointed with the number of ride closures! We were aware that Space Mountain was closed for the year, but many other rides attractions were closed frequently for problems. To list a few:  Indiana Jones   we obtained a fastpass and when we returned the ride was closed. The next day, once again the ride was closed and finally on our third try we managed to get on. (It was a good ride, for your information and worth the wait).  Matterhorn   we were told by other people that they spent 75 minutes in the lineup only to be turned away when they got to the entrance as the ride was shutdown for maintenance after problems. People were led off the ride. This occured on at least 2 3 occasions. We gave up and didn't bother going on it. Pirates of the Caribbean   We went on this ride after about a 30 minute wait and got stuck on it at the part where the town is all singing  Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me!  for at least 30 minutes. This is not a pleasant experience and actually people were getting kind of panicky.  Haunted Mansion   We had a temporary stall when we were on this ride, but only for about 5 minutes. Still, this added to the list of malfunctions in the park.We were not pleased to find we had arrived during the California Spring Easter Break and lineups and crowds were overwhelming.Unlike most reviews, however, we really enjoyed California Adventure. If you are going, check out the restaurant by Soaring over California   the  all dressed fries  (not sure of the name, but they have fries, chili, sour cream, cheese, onions, etc and are fabulous and a good bargain!) The rides are more exciting for older children teenagers and the Aladdin show is awesome. Also, Who Wants to be a Millionaire, a Bug's life, and many others. Very worthwhile.\"\n",
      " \"never again...what a horrible experience, the worst weekend of my life. We went to Disneyland fully understanding that it would be crowded, there would be lines and lots & lots of people..however, there were so many people that you could literally not walk, You had to wait in line to move! Waits for rides were 3 1 2 4 hrs long, waits just to get a speed pass were over 1 hr long. Although we all remained in good spirits and tried to enjoy it, it was impossible. You couldn't even take a picture of each other, it was too crowded. After only 3 hours on our second day there, my nieces asked to leave. On our way out we stopped at Guest Relations to express our unhappiness, and were directed to yet another lengthy line that we would have to wait in, the line to complain which was approximately 60 people deep. We chose not to wait, instead asking for an address where we could send a letter, and were told to wait in the same line to just get that.....never again, what a shame, we planned for months, and spent an incredible amount of money for the worst 2 days of our lives.\"]\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mIn the reviews for Disneyland California location, there are mixed opinions about the food.

I definitely recommend staying walking distance away at one of the hotels on Harbor Blvd or stay at a hotel with its own private shuttle.Disneyland Express   pick up at the airport was flawless however we scheduled a pick up back to the airport but it did not come   we waited for over 1 2 hour and ended up hiring a limo to bring us to John Wayne airport for $45. Ended up losing our pre paid fare which was non refundable. If traveling with at least 4 adults, I would definitely hire a minivan taxi next time   fare is cheaper anyways and they don't require infant or toddler seats, which I did not realize.Hope this helps!\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mOne review about the rides in Disneyland California location mentions that the reviewer's daughter loved the outside rides in Fantasyland, especially the teacup ride, Dumbo, Casey Jr train, and carousel.

      "\u001b[0m\u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mHad a better than expected time with my 2.5 year old girl, infant son, wife and my parents.My daughter loved the Princess Faire   attended the events almost daily, wearing her Snow White dress. My intention was to go for 5th birthday when she'll be able to remember more but it turned out to be a perfect age   she really was excited to see the princesses! Other highlights for her (and us):The daily Sylvania parade   watched the afternoon show which was just fine. The evening show was too late for the little ones.Fantasyland   she loved the outside rides mostly   teacup ride, Dumbo, Casey Jr train, and carousel especially.PhotoPass   for $60 you get a CD of unlimited photos taken by photographers stationed at the main landmarks (eg, Cinderella Castle, with various characters).Bug's Land in California Adventures   about the only place for a toddler   only spent 1 hour here but would spend more time next trip if I had known more about it.. Tame but fun and cute rides for young ones, similar to Fantasy LandNegatives:Food is mediocre   ate at French Cafe, and twice at Plaza Inn.Food was so so at the French Cafe. First time we went to Plaza Inn the fried chicken was very good. Second time we went it tasted slightly strange   like some chemical in the oil that shouldn't be there. The dinner buffet at Storyteller Cafe was decent but also not worth a special trip if you are staying off park.Ariel's Grotto Princess Breakfast   table visits by the princesses were very brief (maybe 1 2 minutes each); Arielle and Belle were very nice but the people playing Snow White and Cinderella were superficially friendly only   not as nice as the ones at the Princess Faire. Food was bad too. My advice   save your money and wait in line to meet them for free at the Princess Faire.Mixed Opinions:Staying off resort   we stayed at the Marriott Suites Garden Grove, a very nice place and much less expensive than the resort hotels. However we had to rely on the ART shuttle which was often very crowded especially in the evening. It was quite miserable luuging a stroller, while standing with a crying infant shoulder to shoulder after a long day at the park in this bus. I definitely recommend staying walking distance away at one of the hotels on Harbor Blvd or stay at a hotel with its own private shuttle.Disneyland Express   pick up at the airport was flawless however we scheduled a pick up back to the airport but it did not come   we waited for over 1 2 hour and ended up hiring a limo to bring us to John Wayne airport for $45.
