## DISNEYLAND DREAMS - Analyzing Sentiments and Creating Personalized Chatbot Experiences:

This project titled, “DISNEYLAND DREAMS – Analyzing Sentiments and creating Personalized
Chatbot Experiences” aims in leveraging Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze
customer sentiments expressed in textual data such as reviews and feedback with respect to
Disneyland Park locations.

This analysis aims to gain insights on visitor perceptions, emotions, and preferences
regarding attractions and experiences at Disneyland locations in California, Paris, and Hong
Kong. It can be accomplished by delving into machine learning and deep learning models for
understanding and predicting the user emotions from text messages.

It is an important factor when it comes to monitoring Customer Satisfaction, Brand
Reputation management, Predictive Analytics on future trends and personalized customer
experience.

The secondary objective of the project is the key innovation of building a Question and Answers (Q&A) chatbot 
from our Disneyland reviews dataset that lies in its ability to tailor responses based on the reviews.
By incorporating sentiment analysis into the chatbot’s logic, we elevate the conversational experience to a new level of empathy and understanding
Users feel heard and acknowledged as the chatbot responds in ways that resonate with their emotions.
